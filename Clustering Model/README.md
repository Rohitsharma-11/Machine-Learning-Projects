## 📌 Project Description  

This project focuses on implementing **K-Means clustering** to group unlabeled data points into distinct clusters. The approach is applied for tasks such as customer segmentation, where businesses can identify meaningful groups of customers based on their attributes.  

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement  

Unsupervised learning is widely used when labeled data is unavailable. The goal of this project is to:  
- Apply **K-Means clustering** to discover natural groupings in the dataset.  
- Determine the optimal number of clusters using methods like **Elbow curve**.
- Visualize the clusters using dimensionality reduction techniques.  
- Interpret results to generate actionable insights.

## 🧩 Project Overview  

We implemented **K-Means clustering** for unsupervised learning to:  
- Cluster unlabeled data points.  
- Identify the optimal number of clusters using **Elbow Method**.  
- Reduce dimensions with **PCA/t-SNE** for visualization.

## 🧾 Data Understanding  

- Dataset contains:  
  - Numerical features describing data points (e.g., customer demographics, purchase behavior).  
- No target variable (unsupervised learning task).  

---

## 🧼 Data Preparation  

- Removed missing/duplicate values.  
- Standardized/normalized numerical features.  
- Prepared dataset for clustering.  

---

## 🤖 Modeling  

### 🔹 K-Means Clustering  
- Applied K-Means with different values of **k**.  
- Used **Elbow Method** to find optimal **k**.  
- Reduced dimensions using **PCA** for visualization.

## 📍 Insights Derived  

1. Identified **distinct customer groups** with unique behavioral/feature patterns.  
2. Clear separation between clusters indicates meaningful segmentation.  
3. Helps in applications like **customer targeting, product recommendation, and marketing strategies**.

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced  

- Choosing the right number of clusters required careful evaluation.  
- High-dimensional data needed dimensionality reduction (PCA/t-SNE) for effective visualization.  
- Sensitive to feature scaling → required normalization.  

---

## 🚀 Future Scope  

- Test other clustering algorithms (Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixtures).  
- Explore feature engineering to enhance clustering performance.  
- Deploy clustering pipeline for real-time applications.

## ✅ Final Outcome  

The **K-Means clustering model** successfully segmented the dataset into meaningful groups. These clusters provide actionable insights for decision-making, particularly in **customer segmentation and marketing optimization**.
