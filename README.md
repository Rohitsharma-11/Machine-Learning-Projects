## ðŸ“– Project Overviews  

### ðŸ”¹ Regression (House Price Prediction)  
- Implemented **Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest**.  
- Compared performance using **RÂ² score & MSE**.  
- **Random Forest achieved 90% accuracy**, best among models.  

---

### ðŸ”¹ Classification (Binary Classification)  
- Models: **Logistic Regression, Random Forest**.  
- Evaluated using **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC**.  
- Both models achieved **100% accuracy** on dataset.  

---

### ðŸ”¹ NLP (Text Classification with Naive Bayes)  
- Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization.  
- Vectorization: **TF-IDF**.  
- Models: **Bernoulli (99%), Multinomial (99%), Gaussian (48%) precision**.  
- Key Insight: Gaussian NB not suitable for sparse text vectors.  

---

### ðŸ”¹ Clustering (Customer Segmentation with K-Means)  
- Applied **K-Means clustering**.  
- Optimal clusters determined using **Elbow Method & Silhouette Score**.  
- Visualized clusters with **PCA/t-SNE**.  
- Useful for customer segmentation & marketing insights.  

---

## ðŸš€ Future Scope  

- Add projects on **Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning**.  
- Explore deployment of models as APIs/web apps.  
- Enhance documentation with **code snippets and visualizations**.
